Bored with finding and replacing files by `find . -type f -name "*.rb" | xargs sed -i "" -e "s/${1}/${2}/"` ?

`findr` is optimized tool to find files in directory recursively and replace texts in the files. findr has the following features:

* **Replace by ruby regexp** : You can replace strings by using regexp in ruby. The behavior of `sed` sometimes differ depends on your os (expecially GNU and BSD ). Moreover, it's hard to replace strings with some contextby using `sed`, for example when replace strings with new line.
* **Show stats** : `findr` shows searched files and results of replacement :tada: It will really help your development. (use ` --no-verbose` option to supress stats)
